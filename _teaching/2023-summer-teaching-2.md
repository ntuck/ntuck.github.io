Developed material and co-taught with two others an introductory course for R.  

Develop materials
======
I reviewed other introductory R courses delivered at similar registers as the How to Learn to Code short course (4 weeks, 8 sessions) and developed materials to introduce R to meet the needs of students. Previous course material was geared towards computer science introduction whereas the student needs were for immediate practical application of R to daily research. Course materials were expanded and improved on by co-teachers throughout the duration of the course.
